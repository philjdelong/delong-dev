	<h1>Projects:</h1>
	<p>
		The projects listed below are a culmination of works completed during my time at Turing as well as post-graduation. My goal is to display the growth that I was able to achieve in just a short amount of time.
	</p>
	<p>
		In attempts to not only learn how to create dynamic, scalable applications, I focused much of my time learning new skills. I wanted to expand upon my knowledge by solidifying familiar concepts as well as incorporate new, useful tools with each project.
